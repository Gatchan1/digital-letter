# digital-letter
"Digital Letter" is a simple website where you can write in a typewriter-like manner.

You can't erase what you've written; you can only cross it over. Also, you can place stickers on the paper!!

Please go ahead and check the deploy! [gatchan1.github.io/digital-letter](https://gatchan1.github.io/digital-letter/)

# developer
Hi! I'm Raquel Barrio (@Gatchan1), I started my journey as a fullstack web developer in 2023.

I love coding, my friends, board games, comics and stationery <3

# languages
HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

# stickers
I drew the sprites for both the letters and the stickers using Aseprite.

The stickers can be placed below the text or above it (I'm actually using four canvas, one on top of the other), and they can also be rotated.
